# Robotic Arm

A robotic arm that carries out gestures done on a hand-controller.

## Description

The first of many personal projects that I would like to undertake. It mainly uses a arduino microcontroller and related accessories with a flex sensor for the controller mounted on a glove. This project would be succeeded by a voice controlled gesture making robotic arm that I would complete before the beginning of my third semester (around June 2025).
